Download FreeDOS 1.3:

FreeDOS 1.3 LiveCD

Most users should use this to install or try out FreeDOS 1.3. If you don't want to install, you can use the LiveCD to run a "live" version of FreeDOS containing many useful FreeDOS programs and utilities.

FreeDOS 1.3 BonusCD

Not everything will fit on the LiveCD. After you've installed FreeDOS, use this non-bootable CD to install other packages you might find useful.

FreeDOS 1.3 LegacyCD

If your system doesn't support booting from the LiveCD, try installing with the LegacyCD. This installs the same FreeDOS 1.3, but uses a different boot method.
